shadowsocks-heroku
==================

shadowsocks-heroku is a lightweight tunnel proxy which can help you get through firewalls. It is a port of [shadowsocks](https://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks), but through a different protocol.

shadowsocks-heroku uses WebSocket instead of raw sockets, so it can be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

Notice that the protocol is INCOMPATIBLE with the origin shadowsocks.
